        "Andler Develops not only develop websites, also video games created with JavaScript, using prototypes and classes, the last on the market on algorithmic questions–ES2015 to ES2020–the same for websites, using modular, functional and classes methodologies. In web, I'm fanatic of ReactJS, familiarizing me with JAMStack development, something amazingly easy to control, implement and create with GatsbyJS, bootstrapped by ReactJS–Sanity.io–for data management and using GraphQL API.",
        "These are my main stack development that I use on each website that I build, but always, open to new horizons, like putting this together with TypeScript, Angular 2-7 and also Vue.js, are some of the technologies that on my career path as a web developer I seek to expand.",

I born and have been raise almost a quarter of century in Nicaragua and I'm making a living in Costa Rica, a country that like my native one, it has offered me awful lot of opportunities to know amazing and interesting persons that came along my road that they have made me think, debate and give what to think.",
        "Since I was a little one, I have the wonderful memory of loving video games, and computers; I remember my first PC, was a Compaq Presario 5460 AMD K6-2, 1999 model:",

        "I remember my first game in PC, it was Age of Empires. I had 6 years old too, loved to be on my computer and play whenever my parents allowed me to; played on easy, that's I assure you.",
        "Growing up, i kept my love to video games and computers, yes, I'm a PC Gamer–nevertheless, I've had a good number of video game consoles–I have never strayed from my true taste, to be in front on a computer, be browsing, playing or even writing. Was like it until the end of my teen ages, where I truly wanted to listen to my heart and search the truth about me, try to hear from me as much as I can.",
        "I end up deciding to find a guide, a place where I could start studying  about programing and from there, at the beggining of my 20's, I met Next University an learned about how to create, at first, primitive things so to speak but like always, I have had the desire for personal improvement, something that I feel is a big part of me.",
        "My father taught me something important and is something that I admire on him, that a good leader is about 'Us' and not about one, the power of one we can say too. As the owner of his own company and family of administrators, I have had a lot of advices since I was a child with them and I have been gathering the good values to implement it when it could be necessary.",
        "Is for that, that I like to help other, challenge people, to see the true value of each one and their potential of each of them that they might have, help them to find themselves and maybe make them questions and make them think, be a coworker, mate, family, couple. Change begins with oneself, Right?"
